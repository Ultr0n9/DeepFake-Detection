# Deepfake Detection(Image,Video,Audio)

# Used Language
Python, Html, Css


# Project Overview
This project output Is it explain the input image/audio/video is Deepfake or not.

Here I take 3 model for 3 parts means Iâ€™m doing all the three parts (image/audio/video) in jupyter notebook for train the models and download it from various format

The Image part is in pkl format, Video part is in pkl format, Audio part is in h5 fomat

# How to run the project

First download the project from Github and unzipping the project

Then you have to download the dataset for training the project

The dataset links are

For Image - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/manjilkarki/deepfake-and-real-images

For Video - https://www.kaggle.com/c/deepfake-detection-challenge/data

For Audio - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UGs1o2mDiBO9_iaN-0FupS8x0Tkb4xmt/view

Then train the models (take the model codes from model creation folder according to image, video, audio)

Then After train the models download the models and arrange all the folder like static, models, templates and app.py in any python environment.

After that install all the librities like opencv, facerecognisation, numpy, liborosa, glob, tensorflow, joblib, torch etc.
Then after that run the app.py and test the project
